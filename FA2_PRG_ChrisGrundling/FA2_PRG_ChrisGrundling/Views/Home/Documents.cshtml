            <p class="mb-0">Every municipality in South Africa is required to produce an Integrated Development Plan, in which the city's
              future is mapped over the short, medium and long-term. Issues that are considered include spatial planning, disaster management, 
              finances, performance targets and economic development.
              The key to the process is "integration" -- meaning that all processes are considered in relation to one another.
